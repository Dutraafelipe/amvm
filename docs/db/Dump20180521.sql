É o machismo, o sentimento de posse do homem sobre a mulher. Pensamento atrasado que não combina com a época em que vivemos. Será que isso é coisa do passado, mesmo? O homem moderno mudou o jeito de pensar? Números do mapa da violência divulgados este ano mostram que pelo principalmente no Norte e Nordeste do país a violência contra a mulher vem aumentando.\r\n\r\nOs números de assassinatos de mulheres no Maranhão são os mais altos, de acordo com o Atlas da Violência, do Instituto de Pesquisas Econômicas e Aplicadas (Ipea). Foi o estado onde este crime mais cresceu entre 2005 e 2015, indo na contramão de estados como São Paulo, onde houve redução de 35%, e Rio de Janeiro, 28%. No Maranhão, o aumento foi de 130%. Foram mais de mil mulheres assassinadas no estado. Em Sergipe o aumento foi de 117%, Rondônia de 103%, Amazonas de 98%, Tocantins de 95%, Rio Grande do Norte de 95% e Pará, 81%\r\n\r\nPara esta psicóloga Artenira Silva, a aplicação mais eficaz da Lei Maria da Penha, criada em 2005 pra proteger mulheres vítimas de violência e punir agressores, poderia evitar que se chegasse a tantos assassinatos de mulheres. Segundo ela, a punição ao agressor deveria acontecer logo nos primeiros sinais de agressão: a violência psicológica.','2017-11-12 03:09:18',1),(2,'CNJ divulga dados do Judiciário sobre violência contra a mulher','Em 2016, tramitaram na Justiça do País mais de um milhão de processos referentes à violência doméstica contra a mulher, o que corresponde, em média, a 1 processo para cada 100 mulheres brasileiras. Desses, pelo menos 13,5 mil são casos de feminicídio. Os dados foram apresentados nesta terça-feira (24/10) pela presidente do Conselho Nacional de Justiça (CNJ) e do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), ministra Cármen Lúcia, durante a 261ª Sessão Ordinária do CNJ. A íntegra está disponível aqui.\r\n\r\nA publicação, com dados relativos à estrutura e à litigiosidade nas unidades judiciárias especializadas em violência contra a mulher, está prevista na Portaria n. 15 de 2017 do CNJ, que instituiu a Política Nacional de Combate à Violência Doméstica no Judiciário. Entre as informações contidas no levantamento estão quantidade de varas especializadas; número e perfil de profissionais que integram as equipes multidisciplinares; quantidade de inquéritos instaurados, de sentenças, assim como de medidas protetivas. Os dados são dos Tribunais de Justiça dos Estados e do Distrito Federal e ficarão disponíveis para consulta pública, no Portal do CNJ. \r\n\r\nLitigiosidade\r\nDe acordo com o Panorama da Política Judiciária de Enfrentamento à Violência Doméstica contra a Mulher, tramitaram na Justiça estadual 1,2 milhão de processos referentes à violência doméstica e familiar, o que corresponde, em média, a 11 processos a cada mil mulheres brasileiras. A região Nordeste é a que apresentou a menor demanda à Justiça, com média de 6,9 processos a cada mil mulheres residentes. Região Norte: 12,1 processos a cada mil mulheres; Região Sudeste: 12,4 processos a cada mil mulheres; Região Sul: 13,2 processos a cada mil mulheres residentes; Centro-Oeste: 19,3 processos a cada mil mulheres.\r\n\r\nCongestionamento\r\nO Judiciário foi capaz de decidir um número de processos superior à demanda de casos novos nesse assunto. Ingressaram nos Tribunais de Justiça 334.088 casos criminais novos em violência doméstica contra a mulher e baixados 368.763 processos, em 2016. Assim, em média, o índice de resposta do Poder Judiciário aos casos de violência doméstica contra mulher foi positivo. No entanto, há tribunais com números que revelam uma taxa de congestionamento alta nesse tipo de processo. É o caso do TJAL (94%), TJBA ((91%) e TJRS (89%). Já as três menores taxas de congestionamento foram verificadas no TJAP (0,3%), no TJSC (31%) e no TJDFT (46%).\r\n\r\nFeminicídio\r\nAinda que alguns tribunais não disponham de estatísticas sobre o feminicídio (caso dos TJAP, TJAL e TJRN), a movimentação processual desse tipo de crime é expressiva. Em 2016 ingressaram 2.904 casos novos de feminicídio na Justiça Estadual do país; tramitaram ao longo do ano um total de 13.498 casos (entre processos baixados e pendentes) e foram proferidas 3.573 sentenças. Os estados com a maior número de casos novos em feminicídio são Minas Gerais (1.139), Pará (670) e Santa Catarina (287). \r\n\r\nExecução Penal\r\nEm 2016 foram iniciados na Justiça Estadual 13.446 processos de execução penal em violência doméstica contra a mulher, tendo sido proferidas 16.133 sentenças em execução penal. Encontravam-se em andamento (pendentes) 15.746 casos de execuções penais em violência doméstica contra a mulher, tendo sido baixados 6.921 processos. \r\n\r\nMedidas Protetivas\r\nForam expedidas 195.038 medidas protetivas de urgência, em todo o País. Vale lembrar que as medidas são voltadas a providências urgentes e podem ser direcionadas ao agressor ou à vítima. Por exemplo, afastar o agressor do lar ou encaminhar a vítima para um programa de proteção ou atendimento.\r\n\r\nO TJRS expediu a maior quantidade em números absolutos de medidas (31.044), seguido do TJMG (22.419) e do TJSP (20.153)  Os tribunais que expediram as menores quantidades de medidas protetivas foram os TJAC (181), TJRO (333), TJRR (799) e TJSE (1.123). O único tribunal que não prestou essa informação foi o TJAL.','2017-11-12 03:09:18',1),(3,'Titulo Noticia 3','Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
